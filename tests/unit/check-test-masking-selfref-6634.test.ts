/**
 * Regression test for issue #6634 ("release/v3.8.47 branch not green — nightly
 * release-green found HARD failures"). The nightly's "Test-masking
 * (weakened-assert guard)" HARD failure was a SELF-REFERENTIAL false positive:
 * tests/unit/check-test-masking.test.ts legitimately embeds tautology-pattern
 * string literals (e.g. `expect(true).toBe(true);`, `assert.equal(1, 1);`) as
 * FIXTURES to exercise countBareTautologies()/scanBareTautologies() — the same
 * literal text that the diff-based subcheck (evaluateMasking(), fed by
 * countTautologies()/countExtendedTautologies()) treated as "new tautologies in
 * the file itself" because those counters are dumb regex scans of raw source
 * text, blind to "this is inside a fixture string, not real assertion code".
 *
 * scanBareTautologies() already special-cases this exact file
 * (`if (file.endsWith("check-test-masking.test.ts")) continue;` in
 * scripts/check/check-test-masking.mjs) for precisely this reason — this test
 * asserts evaluateMasking() now applies the same exclusion for its diff-based
 * tautology counters, using the real base(origin/main)/head(HEAD) diff of
 * tests/unit/check-test-masking.test.ts.
