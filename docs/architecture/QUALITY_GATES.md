# Quality Gates Reference

This document is the authoritative reference for all CI quality gates in OmniRoute.
It describes each gate, what it validates, which CI job it runs in, whether it uses
a ratchet baseline or a pass/fail policy, and whether it blocks the build or is advisory.

For a short summary and the allowlist policy, see the "Quality Gates & Ratchets" section
in `CLAUDE.md`.

## Gate Inventory (35 scripts)

Scripts live under `scripts/check/` (policy gates) and `scripts/quality/` (ratchet engine).
The CI source of truth is `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

### Job: `lint`

Runs on every PR to `main`. Blocks merge on failure.

## Ratchet Baseline (`quality-baseline.json`)

The ratchet engine (`scripts/quality/check-quality-ratchet.mjs`) reads `quality-baseline.json`
and compares it against the freshly collected `quality-metrics.json`. Any metric that regresses
beyond its epsilon fails the build.

Current tracked metrics:

| Metric                | Direction | Meaning                            |
| --------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `eslintWarnings`      | `down`    | ESLint warning count must not grow |
| `coverage.statements` | `up`      | Statement coverage must not fall   |
| `coverage.lines`      | `up`      | Line coverage must not fall        |
| `coverage.functions`  | `up`      | Function coverage must not fall    |
| `coverage.branches`   | `up`      | Branch coverage must not fall      |

To update the baseline after a genuine improvement:

```bash
npm run quality:ratchet -- --update
git add quality-baseline.json
```

The `--update` flag writes the current measured values into `quality-baseline.json`.
Commit this file alongside the change that improved the metric. A PR that improves a
metric without updating the baseline will be caught by `--require-tighten` (Fase 6A.5,
pending implementation).

## Allowlist Policy

Every gate that cannot fail on pre-existing violations uses a frozen allowlist
(e.g., `KNOWN_STALE_DOC_REFS`, `KNOWN_MISSING`, `KNOWN_RAW_SQL`). The policy is:

**Fix the root cause; use the allowlist only when the violation is pre-existing and
cannot be fixed in the same PR.**

When adding an entry to an allowlist:

1. Include a comment with the justification.
2. Reference the tracking issue (e.g., `// #3498 — Phase 2 feature, not yet implemented`).
3. Remove the entry in the same PR that fixes the violation — a stale entry that no longer
   suppresses an active violation is itself a defect (6A.3 stale-enforcement will
   fail the gate on an orphaned allowlist entry once implemented).

Do **not** add allowlist entries to make tests pass faster. A green gate with a growing
allowlist is a false sense of quality.

### When a gate fails on your PR

1. **Read the gate output carefully** — it tells you exactly which file or symbol violated
   the rule.
2. **Fix the violation** — most gates are deterministic filesystem checks that pass as soon
   as the code is correct.
3. **If the violation is pre-existing** (i.e., you did not introduce it but the gate now
   covers it): add an allowlist entry with a justification comment and a tracking issue.
4. **If the gate is a ratchet** (coverage, ESLint warnings, duplication, complexity):
   your change made the metric worse. Fix the underlying issue, or (rarely) run
   `npm run quality:ratchet -- --update` if the change is intentional and the metric
   degradation is acceptable — but document why in the PR description.
5. **Advisory gates** (`continue-on-error: true`) are informational — they do not block
   merge but appear in the CI summary. Fix them anyway.

---

## Adding a New Gate

1. Create `scripts/check/check-<name>.mjs` (or `.ts`). Policy gates exit 0/1.
   Ratchet-style gates emit a metric to `quality-metrics.json` via `collect-metrics.mjs`.
2. Add `"check:<name>": "node scripts/check/check-<name>.mjs"` to `package.json`.
3. Wire it in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` under the appropriate job
   (policy → `lint` or `docs-sync-strict`; ratchet → `quality-gate`).
4. If it has an allowlist, apply `reportStaleEntries()` from
   `scripts/check/lib/allowlist.mjs` so stale entries are detected automatically.
5. Write a test in `tests/unit/build/` covering the gate's detection logic.
6. Update this document (add a row to the relevant job table).
